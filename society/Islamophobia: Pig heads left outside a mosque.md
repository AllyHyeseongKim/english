## Islamophobia: Pig head left outside a mosque
> [The France 24 Observers](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CgsU2XteGjE)

You can see these are the big heads which they have placed.
And this is our temporary prayer place, so they have placed it right in front of our temporary prayer place.

This video was filmed by our observer a student from Pakistan who is attending Kyungbook National University in South Korea. He is one of a few dozen Muslim students at the University who are hoping to open a <mark>mosque</mark>.
They got official permission two years ago but have faced opposition from local Koreans. So they actually organized a barbecue party right outside the mosque gate.

The main aim of them is like to make us irritated. So they keep on doing these kind of effects like placing the pig heads which they have been placed from the 27th October till now they are still placed there.
It's not just because of this section they are continuously doing the various methods and by various actions from the past two years and like whenever we will be passing by so they will call us terrorists. And they also placed English uh like the banners in English. They also distributed the pamphlets against Islam and misinterpreting the Islamic laws or like those kind of things into the houses of the neighbors. I also received that a pamphlet in my house. You can see that our parents going on and like they are constantly playing this music.

Korean courts have backed the creation of the mosque and a Human Rights Commission has found the opponent's actions <mark>discriminatory</mark>.
The <mark>musk</mark>'s critics say they have nothing against Islam they're just worried about the number of people coming and going and the noise and smells that could come from Muslim festivals. They claim that this is not <mark>islamophobia</mark> then what was when they were calling us terrorists.
What were those boards about that I think what they say is different from what they act till now. Why are they placing the pig heads out there because of Islam.
They know that in Islam pig is prohibited. I haven't experienced such kind of islamophobic behavior by the other Koreans and usually specifically the old people when they see my beard in my dress up they try to connect with me. So I think we didn't expect it this it will happen here.
Christianity and Buddhism are the two biggest religions in South Korea. Less than one percent of the population are Muslims. Most of them foreigners and there are just a dozen or so mosques in the country.
