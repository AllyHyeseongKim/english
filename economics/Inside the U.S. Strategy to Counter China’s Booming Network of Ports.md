### China’s trade strategy

> 중국은 국경 밖의 항구를 소유하고 운영한다. 미국은 해외에서 운영하지 않는다.
> 미국은 이를 안보위협으로 보고 있고, 이를 막기 위해 노력했지만 결국 실패했다.
> 중국은 미국과 동맹 네트워크에서 살아남기 위해 이와 같은 정책을 할 수 밖에 없다.

Chinese firms fully or partly own and operate all these ports outside China's borders. There's 95 of them on this map. Meanwhile, US companies don't operate any major ports abroad. For China, these ports have been part of a long-term effort to build global infrastructure. Chinese firms have spent years and billions of dollars to build, operate, and develop ports around the world. American officials view China's expanding network as an increasing security threat, posing significant economic and even military risks.
So what has the US done to counter this? Block China from making more deals to keep ports in so-called friendly hands, but the US has had mixed success. In the past decade, China has spent a trillion dollars on its <mark>Belt And Road Initiative</mark>, a global infrastructure project designed to boost China's economy and political <mark>clout</mark> through government-backed investments in dozens of countries.

The scale of China's trading enterprise is really <mark>staggering</mark>.
Isaac Kardon is a senior fellow at the Carnegie <mark>Endowment</mark> studying China's <mark>maritime affairs</mark>. He and a colleague spent years building a data set of all Chinese owned and operated ports around the world. It currently includes 95 ports across dozens of countries.

The strategic motivations for China, I think, are fundamentally defensive. They feel vulnerable to the United States and its <mark>alliance</mark> network that they could be cut out of the global economic system in some fundamental way. And so I think the drive to make themselves <mark>indispensable</mark> to it and central to it is in part a way of <mark>insulating</mark> themselves against that vulnerability.

Ports are considered national security infrastructure by the US government because they're central to the flow of essential goods like steel and food.
But commercial ports are dual purpose. <mark>They're useful both economically</mark>, China can give its <mark>vessels</mark> priority handling, and lower docking fees, and militarily, docks are used by navies to refuel, <mark>restock</mark>, and <mark>re-arm</mark> ships.
In recent years, the US has worked to keep China from expanding this network in a few strategic regions.

### American ports

> 중국은 해외 항구의 지분을 가지는 3개의 주요 물류, 해운 회사가 있다.
> 그 중에서 Cosco는 미국 주요 항구의 지분을 갖는다.
> Cosco의 Long Beach 지분이 커지자 미국은 이를 규제하고 Cosco가 터미널을 팔았지만 아직 중국 회사들이 주요한 역할을 하고 있다.
> 미국은 이를 안보 문제라고 생각한다.

China has three main shipping and logistics companies that own most of its stakes in overseas ports, Cosco Shipping Ports, China Merchants Port and Hutchison Ports. Cosco and China Merchants are both owned by China's central government, while Hutchinson is privately owned.
Cosco is an investor in several key US ports, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Seattle. But in 2017, when Cosco almost took over operation of a Long Beach container terminal, US regulators stepped in. The Trump administration blocked them from getting control out of national security concerns. Ultimately, Cosco sold the terminal, but Chinese firms are still a major presence at US ports.
Cosco still has a major stake in another container terminal at Long Beach from a preexisting deal, and lots of port infrastructure like the cranes that move cargo from ship to shore is made in China.
Lately, some US officials have argued that's a security concern too. There's growing <mark>suspicion</mark> that anything which is controlled by China is used to spy on the United States. There's been procedures at the US government to see whether the cranes at American ports, which are made in China, are used to spy on the operations of the port.

### European ports

> 미국은 유럽의 항구에 대한 중국의 투자를 막고자 했다. 함부르크 항구의 한 컨테이너 터미널 투자 지분을 줄였다. 하지만 중국의 투자는 그 나라의 큰 이익이므로 딜레마이다.
> 크로아티아에서도 비슷한 일이 있었다. 하지만 이곳에서는 미국이 성공적으로 중국의 계약을 취소할 수 있었다.

In Europe, the US has also been trying to block China from expanding its <mark>stake</mark> in ports and controlling the flow of goods to the continent. But US officials have had mixed success convincing countries that security concerns outweigh the benefits of Chinese state investment. In Hamburg, Germany's largest port, Cosco planned to buy a 35% stake in one of the port's container terminals. Government officials reduced the potential stake to 24.9% but still faced criticism from the US and many in the German government. The country's <mark>chancellor</mark> ultimately permitted the deal to move forward, but the offer is still pending review.

The United States would advise and press any country in the world not to accept Chinese investments. It's a big dilemma for countries because the Chinese have the cash to invest, which means this creates a lot of jobs, and it also improves the outputs of those countries. The Hamburg deal though continues to face opposition which will make it difficult to move forward.

In the past, such small investment wouldn't even make news. It's just <mark>indicative</mark> of how tense the relations of the Western world are with Beijing.

A similar scene played out in Croatia, but in that case, the US was more successful. It used <mark>behind the scenes diplomacy</mark> to have Croatia cancel a deal it had made with Chinese firms looking to operate a container terminal in Rijeka and give the contract to a Danish company, Maersk, instead. Rijeka is strategically valuable because it's close to the Suez Canal and has access to central European markets. The US government was particularly concerned about the deal because the US Navy and NATO sometimes use the port to move military equipment in and out of Europe. China could have made that more difficult.

What Western intelligence officials are saying is that by controlling this terminals, they could eventually have a navy installation there, in the future. I don't think this will be the case, especially in any European point in time soon, but it could happen in Africa.

### African ports

> 미국은 아프리카에 많은 군사 기지와 협정을 맺고 있지만 중국은 한 곳에만 가지고 있다. 하지만 중국은 많은 상업 항구를 가지고 있다.
> 미국은 중국이 상업 항구를 통해 군사 기지를 추가로 확보할 것을 우려하고 있다.
> 특히, 대서양 연안에 있는 군사 기지를 가지지 않도록 노력하고 있다.

The US has <mark>arrangements</mark> with dozens of military bases in Africa, including several on the continent's west, north, and east coasts. China has just one base in Djibouti, but while US firms don't own commercial ports in Africa, Chinese firms own many. US officials have been concerned about China building on the relationships it's formed through commercial ports to establish additional permanent military bases in Africa, especially on the Atlantic ocean, waters the US considers <mark>home turf</mark>.

The thing I think I'm most worried about is this military base on the Atlantic coast, and where they have the most <mark>traction</mark> for that today is in <mark>Equatorial</mark> Guinea. In Equatorial Guinea, the US has been trying to convince country officials to reject China's bid to build a military base in the city of Bata, where China already has a commercial port deep enough for naval <mark>vessels</mark> to dock. 

It's easy to put, install naval facility at a commercial port. If the port infrastructure is there, it can be used by a navy ship. There are, I think, real concerns that eventually you will see Chinese warships docking at that port.

If it were to establish a military base there, Equatorial Guinea would be China's first base on the Atlantic, which would enable Chinese warships to re-arm opposite the East Coast of the US. US officials have gone to Equatorial Guinea to persuade leaders there to reject China's <mark>overtures</mark> but it's unclear whether the diplomatic <mark>outreach</mark> will <mark>fend off</mark> a Chinese naval presence there.

This will be something that US officials are watching closely. Beijing hopes that it could in the future have a military presence in terminals and ports that it controls.

Whether it is or isn't defensive is almost <mark>irrelevant</mark>. It has security consequences. We need to be <mark>attuned</mark> to those. We need to focus on what we're trying to accomplish and maybe that means we do need to counter China at various turns but that competition is not gonna be one for one, you get a port, we get a port. It's more like what can we do to secure our own maritime trade and transport, because ultimately that's what they're doing. It just has negative externalities for our own ability to feel secure in maritime trade.
